# Morphological-Character-Hierarchies
In this repository, you can find all the code and data used in my final year project.
As I'm still very new to GitHub, this repository is a bit of messy at the moment! But, I hope that this brief description will make it easier to navigate the repository.

The files present in the "Data" folder are named after the lead author(s) whose morphological data sets I analysed using PAUP*, Morphy and Anagallis.

Within each of the study folders, you can find character matrices, character lists, files containing the trees found by each programme and the R scripts used to analyse those trees.
Files relating to PAUP* are marked "Paup", Morphy marked "Morphy" and Anagallis marked "Ana".
Character matrices can be identified by the extensions .nex and .tnt while tree lists contain "tree" in their filenames (files labelled "contree" describe the consensus tree generated by one of the programmes).

Data obtained from tree comparison analyses are pooled into .csv (and .numbers) files in the "Data" folder and the R scripts in this folder were used to carry out analyses across the data sets.
